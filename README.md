### Hello from Cordoba, Argentina 👋

#### Roberto Paz - SRE

I'm working with open source platforms from more than 25 years now.

Most of my professional career was as a freelance programmer strongly oriented to electronic developments (I'm in fact an electronic engineer). Dealing with most of the projects by myself forced me to dig in a lot of different technologies during all these 20 years.

- 🔭 Today I prefer to be more involved in projects related to infrastructure, doing still a lot of programming related to orchestration, IaaC, etc.

- 🤔 I'm working hard to leave behind all legacy oriented infrastructure tasks and embrace IaaC almost exclusively.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning all **kubernetes** related stuff.

- ⚛️ I'm currently doing a lot of **ansible** on my 9 to 6 job.

- 🚀 Some programming languages that I use
  - Python
  - C
  - Perl
  - A bunch of declarative yaml-based languages for ansible, puppet, etc.

#### Additional info

📌 I currently live in Cordoba, Argentina (I expect to move to a smaller town soon, fingers crossed).

🌱 Big fan of sustainability, clean energy, trash generation reduction, etc.

🤓 I'm always trying to learn new things.
