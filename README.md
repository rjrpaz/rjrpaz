### Hello, this is Roberto from Cordoba, Argentina 👋

#### UNIX Engineer - SRE

I'm working with open source platforms from more than 25 years now. Most of my professional career was as a freelance programmer strongly oriented to electronic developments (I'm in fact an electronic engineer).

I had to deal with most parts of every project I was involved by myself. That forced me to dig in a lot of different technologies during all these years.

- 🔭 Today I prefer to be more involved in projects related to **infrastructure**, doing still a lot of programming related to *orchestration*, *IaaC*, etc.

- 🤔 I'm working hard to leave behind all legacy oriented infrastructure tasks and embrace **IaaC** almost exclusively.

- ☁️ I’m currently learning all **kubernetes** related stuff.

- ⚛️ I'm currently doing a lot of **ansible** on my 9 to 6 job.

- 🚀 Some programming languages that I use:
  - Python
  - C
  - Perl
  - A bunch of declarative yaml-based languages (ansible, puppet, etc).

#### About me

🏡 I currently live in Cordoba, Argentina (I expect to move to a smaller town soon -fingers crossed-).

👫 In a relationship.

🐱🐱 two cats.

#### Additional interests

🌱 Big fan of sustainability, clean energy, trash generation reduction, etc.

🤓 I'm always trying to learn new things.
